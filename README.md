# Doors & levers game

## Story
You find yourself locked in some sort of a
 dungeon in the pitch darkness. You don't
 remember how you got here (maybe you were
 poisoned or hypnotized or maybe I'm just too
 lazy to make up this part of the story). Anyway,
 the only way out is through this metal door,
 and you need to find out how to open it.

## Controls

`S` — move backward  
`A` — move left  
`D` — move right  
`Mouse/Touchpad` — look around  
`SHIFT` — run

## Motivation
* Try to create a 3d interactive game with CSS 3d
 transforms only (no canvases)
* Become more experienced in React/Redux/Webpack/Tape
* Try out various web APIs useful for HTML5 games
like: [Pointer Lock API](https://w3c.github.io/pointerlock/),
[Web Audio API](https://webaudio.github.io/web-audio-api/),
[Gamepad API](https://w3c.github.io/gamepad/).
